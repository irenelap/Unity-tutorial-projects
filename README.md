# Unity-tutorial-projects
This repository contains all the materials required for Project 1 of the subject Fundamentals of Game Development coursed in LUT during the Autumn fall, 2019.
Two already created Unity beginner projects along with its playable folders (and source codes), a self-made tutorial video explaining how do they work and the GDD of my future own game can be found in this Tutorial Games repository.
